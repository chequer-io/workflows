# workflows
A few demonstrative automation templates for Okta Workflows

# prerequisites

These templates are used in Okta Workflows and users can just simply import these templates and apply them into thier Okta Workflows.
Nevertheless, you may be required to have the followings in order to apply these workflows in your Okta environment:
    1. Access to Okta Workflows with Okta Super Administrator role;
    2. Minimum subscription of Okta SSO+UD which may allow maximum 5 workflows for free;
      - You may separately need to open a case to enable Workflows console for your org in case you do not find the Workflows console under Workflows menub within Okta Admin Console. 
    3. Connections to 3rd-party apps which you are trying to create automation with
      - Depending on your subscription level to those 3rd-party apps, a few API calls may NOT be permitted from those apps; thus, it is highly recommended to check your subscription before implementing workflows on it.
